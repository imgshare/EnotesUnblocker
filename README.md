# Enotes Unblocker
*A very quickly made script that probably unblocks enotes homework help*

**Steps to use:**
1. Download [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or ~~[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)~~ (I designed it in Chrome, Firefox is different, I tried to get it to work but gave up after 30 mins, might come back and add Firefox support later.)
2. Once you have Tampermonkey dowloaded, click [this link](https://gist.github.com/imgshare/f8dc63e464f5534893288c3143af590e/raw/c8f178e272f068565dc42d2022ac106e3e8a411e/enoteunblocker.user.js)
3. If you dont recieve any prompts from the Tampermonkey extention, you have to reinable it in chrome://extentions
